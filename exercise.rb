  # Assume that "str" is a sequence of words separated by spaces.
  # Return a string in which every word in "str" that exceeds 4 characters is replaced with "marklar".
  # If the word being replaced has a capital first letter, it should instead be replaced with "Marklar".
  def self.marklar(str)
    # TODO: Implement this method
    str.gsub(/\w{5,}/) { |word| word.capitalize == word ? "Marklar" : "marklar" }
  end

  # Return the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, up to
  # the "nth" term in the sequence
  # eg. the Fibonacci sequence up to 6 terms is (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8),
  # and the sum of its even numbers is (2 + 8) = 10
  def self.even_fibonacci(nth)
    # TODO: Implement this method
    fib = [1, 1]
    while fib.length < nth
      fib << fib[-1] + fib[-2]
    end
    fib.select(&:even?).reduce(:+) || 0
  end
